# Pygame-Examples
Collection of miscellaneous Python projects using the Pygame library.

### A-Star Pathfinding Demo
- A demonstartion of the A* pathfinding algorithm to find shortest path between point A & B on a grid while also avoiding obstacles.

### Particle System
- A 2D particle system that is fully customizable, inluding particle size, shape, density, and speed
- Also includes example of my Pygame GUI that consists of customzable button, label, and textbox widgets. Made completely from rendered text and basic Pygame shapes

### Interesting Lines
- Just something I threw together in my freetime. Basically a bunch of points with random vectors, and if they come within a certain distance then a line of varying color is drawn betweeen them.
